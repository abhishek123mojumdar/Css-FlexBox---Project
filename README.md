A special mention to @RoadSideCoder
[Edit on StackBlitz ⚡️](https://stackblitz.com/edit/js-rorqbr)

This is an attempt to understand and have an hands on experience on Flex-Box.
Flex box is an awesome css property that helps us to design web pages with much ease
In this project I have tried to implement different properties of flex box that I have learned online

For all the beginners , this would be a nice place to start , you can read through the comments in the CSS file it will surely help you theoretically

The main properties of flex box that we need to take care are

display : flex

flex-direction

justify-content

align-items

align-self

wrap

order
